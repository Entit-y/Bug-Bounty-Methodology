## Description :

Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a bug that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

## Testing :
#### Reflected :
	- Manually submit unique input in every input field you can find on the target and Identify every location on the target where this input was reflected in the http response
	- Make sure to submit every single key on the keyboard at every input field you can find. this is to determine which keys are being black listed by the waf.
> you can use the [[XSS Vibes]] tool to check for black listed and allowed inputs on an endpoint
