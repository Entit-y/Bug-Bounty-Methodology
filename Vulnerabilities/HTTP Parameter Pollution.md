## Description: 

HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates the parameters of a web request to confuse or compromise the application's processing of those parameters. In a typical HTTP request, parameters are sent in the URL or as part of the request body, and they are used by the web application to perform specific actions or provide input.

With HTTP Parameter Pollution, an attacker tries to inject additional or modified parameters into the request. This can lead to various issues, such as:

1. **Data Confusion:** The application may get confused about which values to use, leading to unpredictable behaviour.
2. **Security Bypass:** The attacker may manipulate parameters to bypass security controls or gain unauthorized access.
3. **Denial of Service:** By overwhelming the application with conflicting or excessive parameters, an attacker could degrade the application's performance or even cause it to crash.
4. **Information Disclosure:** HPP might lead to the disclosure of sensitive information if the attacker successfully manipulates parameters to expose data.
