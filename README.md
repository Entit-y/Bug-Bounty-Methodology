# Bug-Bounty-Methodology

This is a compilation of all my notes on bug bounty hunting

## HOW TO USE:
I made this using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download), so if you're gonna use this it'll be best if you download and use it as well.
This is still a work in progress, expect constant updates from time to time üëç
